        "# **Introduction to In-Context Learning Demo: Pattern Completion using the ARC Corpus**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we present a complete step-by-step walkthrough of how Large Language Models (LLMs) can **learn and apply visual completion and transformation patterns purely from few-shot examples**. Inspired by *[Large Language Models as General Pattern Machines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04721)* (Mirchandani et al., 2023), this demo uses the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) introduced in  *[On the Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547)* (Chollet, 2019) as the source of structured input–output patterns and evaluates Gemini’s ability to recognize and generalize these patterns through in-context learning (ICL). The goal is to illustrate how an LLM without updates to any weights can observe a handful of small grid transformations and then correctly generate the missing output for a novel test example. The result is a learning paradigm that is purely based on the forward pass of the LLM without requiring any gradient-based updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "This demonstration guides you through:\n",
        "1.   Loading the ARC tasks\n",
        "2.   Constructing an ICL prompt composed of example input–output pairs\n",
        "3.   Prompting Gemini using the constructed prompt for it to infer the underlying transformation\n",
        "4. Extract and render the model’s predicted test output\n",
        "\n",
        "The result is a clear visualization of how LLMs can act as pattern machines, discovering abstract rules from minimal supervision.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Background**\n",
        "The Abstract and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a benchmark introduced by François Chollet to evaluate generalization, abstraction, and concept learning in AI systems. Unlike standard vision datasets, ARC focuses on Few-shot learning and minimal prior knowledge. The underlying hypothesis is that the learning systems would discover abstract rules that allow for human-like pattern induction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Let's Take a Look at an Example**\n",
        "\n",
        "The figure below shows an example from the ARC dataset and demonstrates how a model identifies and applies a transformation rule. The training examples provide few-shot demonstrations of the underlying pattern. Each training example has an input pattern and an output pattern. In the example below, the output can be regarded as a de-noised version of the input. The test query is a new input from the corpus that follows the same rule. In the case below, the test query is an input image that includes a number of noisy or corrupted pixels. The task of the LLM is to generate the corrected output image which adjusts for these corrupted pixels. The underlying assumption of ICL is that the large language model can learn what sort of transformation to perform, e.g., de-noising, from the few-shot examples alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-icl/intro-to-icl.github.io/refs/heads/master/static/images/sequence_transformation_1.png\" height=\"500\">\n",
        "\n",
        "**In this specific example, the learned transformation is a de-noising operation that fills in and removes any corrupted pixels or segments.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## **LLM as the Optimizer**\n",
        "In our demo, we leverage Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash to perform in-context learning (ICL) on Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)–style grid transformation tasks. Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches, the LLM is never trained on the task. Instead, it infers the underlying transformation rule purely from the examples we provide in the prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process can be understood as a sequence of structured steps: preparing the training examples, constructing a carefully engineered prompt, invoking the LLM to infer the rule, and finally converting its output back into a grid. The LLM behaves as a reasoning engine, reading the examples like a story and deducing the pattern that connects them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Code Overview**\n",
        "The implementation is organized into a modular structure, with each component responsible for a different stage of the ARC task-solving pipeline. This design separates data loading, visualization, prompt construction, LLM inference, and result interpretation, making the system easy to understand, modify, and extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Before Running the Demo, Follow the Instructions Below**\n",
        "To run the full experiment:\n",
        "1. Ensure all dependencies are imported and installed.\n",
        "2.\tVisit Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/) to obtain your Gemini API key.\n",
        "3.\tOnce API key is generated, copy and paste it into the demo when prompted.\n",

        "## **Summary**\n",
        "This demo showcases how Large Language Models can perform in-context learning by recognizing visual transformation patterns from a small number of examples. Using tasks from the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), we construct prompts that present input–output grid pairs and then ask the model to generate the missing transformation for a new test input. Through this setup, we observe how the model identifies the hidden rule by examining the structure of the grids rather than relying on built-in symbolic reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the specific task illustrated here, the same methodology can be applied to a wide spectrum of ARC-style transformations. By crafting carefully chosen few-shot examples, we can guide the model toward discovering diverse rules such as color mappings, object counting, symmetry detection, region extraction, movement operations, and shape reconstruction. These extensions demonstrate how flexible the in-context learning framework is when applied to structured, symbolic data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Conclusion**\n",
        "This demonstration highlights that LLMs can generalize abstract rules similar to human inductive reasoning, even when reasoning over symbolic grid data. By providing only a few examples, the model can infer the underlying transformation and apply it to new cases—capturing the essence of in-context learning. Although the model does not perform explicit algorithmic reasoning, its ability to internalize and reproduce patterns suggests strong potential for tasks requiring rapid generalization from limited data. ARC serves as a valuable testing ground for understanding these capabilities, revealing both the promise and the limitations of treating LLMs as general pattern machines.\n",
