        "# **Introduction to In-Context Learning Demo: Language Conditioned Time Series Prediction**\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Overview**\n",
        "In this notebook we show how Large Language Models (LLMs) can **learn and forecast physiological patterns from real-world time-series data** while also taking into account information provided in language form. This experiment uses full-day glucose measurements paired with meal logs to examine how effectively Gemini can internalize meal–glucose dynamics and predict future glucose trajectories. Traditional approaches to blood glucose prediction only take into account numerical data. However, knowing what foods the user take is critical in order to make realistic predictions of the blood glucose levels. **We leverage the fact that ICL uses LLMs in order to incorporate linguistic information about the user's diet into the prediction process**. We also highlight that LLMs already have substantial medical knowledge about glucose levels, Glycemic indeces and the role of diet on healthy bloodsugar levels. The goal is to highlight how an LLM can observe natural daily glucose patterns, understand how meals impact glycemic response, and extend that behavior into an unseen test day.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Background**\n",
        "This demo focuses on real or simulated full-day sequences that include:\n",
        "- Glucose measurements recorded over the course of a day\n",
        "- Meal logs that act as the driving input events\n",
        "- Mentioning the  Glycemic Index (GI) explicitly, so that the LLM infers extra nutritional context\n",
        "\n",
        "Each daily sequence captures natural dependencies such as meal timing, carbohydrate response, and gradual glucose decay. These sequences form the in-context “training set” that the LLM observes before generating predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "What makes this setup particularly interesting:\n",
        "- The model sees realistic temporal meal–glucose dynamics\n",
        "- Prompts can include or exclude mention of GI without changing data\n",
        "- The LLM is never given explicit physiological equations\n",
        "- The test day requires generalization, not memorization\n",
        "- Predictions are generated step-by-step (using time points), mimicking real forecasting behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "This setting offers an intuitive benchmark for understanding whether an LLM can learn biological response patterns simply through context alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Let's Take a Look at an Example**\n",
        "The illustration below shows an example of a test day containing glucose readings and meal times. Starting with the beginning of a new day the LLM must forecast. The model receives several complete daily sequences of previous days as examples, each showing how meals shape the glucose curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-icl/intro-to-icl.github.io/refs/heads/master/static/images/glucose_prediction_1.png\" height=\"500\">\n",
        "\n",
        "## **LLM as the Forecaster**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this demo, we use Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash in non-reasoning mode, ensuring the model focuses on direct pattern continuation rather than analytical or symbolic interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow is straightforward:\n",
        "- Provide several full-day glucose + meal sequences\n",
        "- Append a future day with partial context\n",
        "- Ask the model to predict one glucose value at a time\n",
        "- Iterate until the full sequence is completed\n",
        "\n",
        "Two prompting strategies are tested:\n",
        "- Mention of Glycemic Index: The prompt instructs the model to factor in Glycemic Index\n",
        "- No mention of Glycemic Index: No explicit nutritional guidance is included\n",
        "\n",
        "The LLM acts as a sequence forecaster—absorbing temporal structure, meal-driven spikes, and recovery patterns from the examples and applying them to the new day.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Evaluation**\n",
        "Finally, we compare these predictions against a Gaussian Process Regression baseline and evaluate performance using RMSE and MSE, providing insight into how well LLMs can approximate physiological patterns through in-context learning alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Code Overview**\n",
        "The implementation is organized into a modular structure, with each component responsible for a different stage of the glucose forecasting pipeline. This design separates data preparation, visualization, prompt construction, LLM inference, and performance evaluation, making the system easy to understand, modify, and extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Before Running the Demo, Follow the Instructions Below**\n",
        "To run the full experiment:\n",
        "1. Ensure all dependencies are imported and installed.\n",
        "2.\tVisit Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/) to obtain your Gemini API key.\n",
        "3.\tOnce API key is generated, copy and paste it into the demo when prompted.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This demo illustrates how LLMs can perform ICL to forecast physiological time-series data, using daily glucose measurements paired with meal events as the foundation. By providing the model with several full-day examples, we show that it can internalize natural glycemic patterns—such as post-meal spikes and gradual return to baseline—and extend them to generate predictions for an unseen future day.\n",
        "\n",
        "We explore two prompting strategies for predicting glucose levels. In the first strategy, the prompt explicitly instructs the model to infer GI values when generating its outputs. In the second strategy, the prompt provides only the input line, without mentioning GI at all, leaving the model to independently determine what information to extract and how to contextualize it. Comparing these two approaches allows us to analyze how the LLM’s outputs differ, how the presence or absence of explicit guidance shapes its reasoning process\n",
        "\n",
        "Alongside the two LLM-based approaches, we also construct a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) baseline using traditional time-series lag features, providing a grounded benchmark for assessing the strengths and limitations of in-context learning in this setting. When compared against this baseline, both the ICL approach that explicitly incorporates the guidance for using the Glycemic Index and withut the GI guidance performs the best—capturing meaningful glucose trends and achieving the lowest MSE and RMSE values. On the other hand, while the baseline model achieves relatively average/similar error, it fails to reproduce realistic temporal patterns shown in the graph, instead relying strictly on short-term lag structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The same methodology demonstrated here can be extended beyond glucose forecasting to a wide range of physiological and behavioral time-series tasks. By curating a small number of representative examples, LLMs can be prompted to learn patterns related to circadian rhythms, activity cycles, medication effects, or other temporal health signals. These extensions highlight the flexibility of in-context learning when applied to structured real-world sequences, opening the door to rapid pattern generalization without the need for explicit mechanistic models.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "This demonstration shows that LLMs can generalize temporal patterns in a way that resembles human intuition—capturing meal-driven glucose dynamics from only a handful of daily examples. Even without explicit physiological equations, the model can infer relationships between meals and glucose responses and apply them to forecast an entire future day. While the LLM does not perform mechanistic or medical reasoning, its ability to approximate nonlinear biological behavior through pattern recognition underscores the potential of in-context learning for health-related time-series tasks. Comparing the LLM’s predictions to a GPR baseline further reveals where LLMs excel and where traditional models remain competitive, offering a balanced perspective on the opportunities and limitations of treating LLMs as general sequence pattern learners."
