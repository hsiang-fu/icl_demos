        "# **Prompted Policy Search (ProPS): Reinforcement Learning through Linguistic and Numerical Reasoning in LLMs**\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook serves as a detailed tutorial on *[Prompted Policy Search (ProPS)](https://props-llm.github.io/)* (Zhou et al., 2025) a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop; directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we utilize a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically the Gemini 2.0/2.5 Flash, to perform Policy Search for a linear control policy within an OpenAI Gym reinforcement learning environment. Our focus will be on the MountainCar environment, where we aim to employ the Gemini family of models to discover the optimal parameters for a simple linear policy that enables the car to successfully reach its goal.\n",

        "## **Environment: State and Action Variables**\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-icl/intro-to-icl.github.io/refs/heads/master/static/images/mountain_car.gif\" height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-icl/intro-to-icl.github.io/refs/heads/master/static/images/mountaincar_parameters.png\" height=\"200\">\n",
        "\n",
        "The MountainCar environment presents a classic control challenge framed as a deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this setup, the environment's future state depends solely on the current state and the action taken, not on the history of preceding states. The term \"deterministic\" signifies that a specific action performed in a particular state will consistently lead to the identical next state and reward. The core task involves an underpowered car, initially placed randomly in the valley between two hills. The objective is to drive the car to the goal located at the top of the right hill. Due to the car's limited engine power, it cannot ascend the steep slope directly. Instead, the agent must learn a strategy of driving back and forth, building momentum to eventually conquer the hill.\n",
        "\n",
        "Control over the car is exerted by applying an external force at each discrete timestep. This force is determined by an action value, $a$, chosen from the continuous range [-1, 1]. This action value is then scaled by a constant factor (0.0015) to yield the actual physical force applied. A positive action propels the car rightward, while a negative action pushes it leftward. At every timestep, the agent observes the environment's current state, which is captured by a two-dimensional vector:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ v \\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, $x$ represents the car's horizontal position (ranging from -1.2 to 0.6, with the goal at 0.5), and $v$ denotes its current velocity (ranging from -0.07 to 0.07). The environment provides a reward signal at each step; typically, this is -0.1 per step to encourage speed, plus a significant bonus (e.g., +100) upon reaching the goal.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Policy Representation**\n",
        "\n",
        "In reinforcement learning, the agent's behavior is dictated by a \"policy,\" which essentially maps observed states to appropriate actions. For this specific problem, we adopt a straightforward **linear policy**. This implies that the action is calculated as a linear combination of the current state variables (position and velocity). This policy is parameterized by a weight matrix (in this case, a 2x1 vector) denoted as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$θ = \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a state $s^T = [x, v]$, the action is computed through a dot product:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$π_θ = s^T θ = x \\cdot θ_1 + v \\cdot θ_2$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The parameters $θ_1$ and $θ_2$ quantify the influence of the car's position and velocity, respectively, on the chosen action. The central aim of our optimization process is to determine the specific values for $θ_1$ and $θ_2$ that result in the highest possible total reward accumulated over an entire episode.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Optimization Strategy: LLM-Driven Policy Search**\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental objective is to identify the optimal policy parameters $π_θ$ that maximize the cumulative reward $R$ gathered over a complete episode, which consists of a sequence of steps from the start until termination (either reaching the goal or hitting the maximum step limit, e.g., 1000). This task is formally known as **Policy Search**. Mathematically, we seek to solve:\n",
        "$$ \\max_{θ} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{T} r_t \\right]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $r_t$ is the reward at timestep $t$ and $T$ is the episode length.\n",
        "\n",
        "To facilitate this optimization, we utilize a \"Replay Buffer.\" After each episode concludes, having been run with the current parameters $θ$, the total reward $R$ is calculated. This $(θ, R)$ pair is then stored in the buffer. We approach the relationship between the policy parameters $π_θ$ and the resulting reward $R$ as a **black-box function**. This means the optimizer, which is the LLM in our case, operates without explicit knowledge of the MountainCar environment's internal physics or reward structure. It only observes the input parameters $θ$ and the corresponding output reward $R$.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **LLM as the Optimizer**\n",
        "\n",
        "We harness the capabilities of the Gemini models to conduct this black-box optimization. The LLM is instructed via a prompt to function as an optimization assistant. The process begins with a \"warmup\" phase, where several episodes are run using randomly selected parameters $π_θ$. The resulting $(θ, R)$ pairs populate the Replay Buffer, providing initial data. Subsequently, the LLM is presented with a detailed prompt containing the optimization goal, the historical data from the Replay Buffer, output format instructions, and guidance on balancing exploration (trying novel parameters) versus exploitation (refining promising parameters), adapting this balance as the optimization progresses. Based on this prompt and the historical context (enabling in-context learning), the LLM proposes a new set of parameters $θ$ anticipated to yield improved rewards.\n",

        "The agent's policy is then updated with these suggested parameters, and one or more evaluation episodes are executed in the environment. The cumulative reward obtained from these evaluations is recorded, and the new $(π_θ, \\text{cumulative } R)$ pair is added to the Replay Buffer. This cycle of prompting the LLM, receiving parameter suggestions, evaluating the updated policy, and updating the buffer is repeated for a predetermined number of episodes (e.g., 400), allowing the LLM to iteratively refine the policy parameters towards optimality. The prompt design treats the task purely as optimizing an unknown function $f(θ_1, θ_2) = R$, guiding the LLM with hints on step size and search ranges but without revealing the underlying simulation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Code Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation follows a modular design. The **World** component (`MountaincarContinuousActionWorld`) wraps the standard Gymnasium environment, managing state transitions, reward calculations, and episode termination. The **Agent** component (`MountaincarContinuousActionLLMNumOptimAgent`) integrates the learning elements. It includes the **`LinearPolicy`** module, which stores the policy weights ($θ_1, θ_2$) and computes actions based on states. It also contains the **`EpisodeRewardBufferNoBias`** module, responsible for maintaining the Replay Buffer of (weights, reward) pairs. Finally, the **`LLMBrain`** module orchestrates all interactions with the LLM, including prompt generation using Jinja2 templates, API communication (handling both OpenAI and Gemini models), and parsing the LLM's responses to extract the suggested new parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Hyperparameters**\n",
        "\n",
        "Several hyperparameters govern the experiment's execution. `NUM_EPISODES` (e.g., 400) sets the total number of optimization iterations. `RENDER_MODE` controls environment visualization. `MAX_TRAJ_COUNT` (e.g., 1000) defines the Replay Buffer size, influencing the historical context available to the LLM. `MAX_TRAJ_LENGTH` (e.g., 1000) sets the maximum steps per episode. `LLM_MODEL_NAME` specifies the LLM used. `NUM_EVALUATION_EPISODES` (e.g., 20) determines how many runs are averaged to evaluate a new policy. `WARMUP_EPISODES` (e.g., 20) sets the number of initial random runs. `SEARCH_STD` (e.g., 1.0) provides a hint to the LLM regarding the step size for parameter exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Training Loop**\n",
        "<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n",
        "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intro-to-icl/intro-to-icl.github.io/1daf690cda61281b95befc6d65893bc0417c0d0e/static/images/mountaincar_loop.svg\" alt=\"image\">\n",

        "<br />\n",
        "\n",
        "The `run_training_loop` function orchestrates the process. It initializes the World and Agent components. It performs the initial warmup runs if necessary, populating the replay buffer. Then, it enters the main loop, iterating `NUM_EPISODES` times. In each iteration, it interacts with the LLM (`agent.train_policy`) to get updated policy parameters based on the replay buffer history. It then evaluates the performance of this new policy over `NUM_EVALUATION_EPISODES` (`agent.evaluate_policy`), calculates the cumulative reward, and adds the new (parameters, cumulative reward) pair back into the replay buffer. Logging occurs at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Output Structure**\n",
        "\n",
        "The training process generates structured logs. A main log directory contains subdirectories for each episode (`episode_*`) and potentially a `warmup/` directory. Each episode directory stores logs of evaluation trajectories, the parameters suggested by the LLM for that episode (`parameters.txt`), and the full LLM interaction including its reasoning (`parameters_reasoning.txt`). The final notebook cells typically include code for visualizing the learned policy in action and plotting the reward curve over episodes, illustrating the learning progress."

        "The `Reward Curve` plotted over the training episodes illustrates the progressive improvement of the learned policy. Typically, in early stages of training, rewards fluctuate due to random initialization and broad exploration. As the LLM repeatedly refines the parameters, the curve begins to rise steadily, indicating that the model is discovering more effective control strategies. Eventually, the reward curve stabilizes, reflecting convergence toward a locally optimal linear policy for the environment."

        "## **Summary**\n",
        "This demo illustrates how Large Language Models, within the Prompted Policy Search (ProPS) framework, can act as central reasoning engines for reinforcement learning by jointly leveraging linguistic and numerical cues. Rather than relying on gradient-based updates or analytic models of the environment, the LLM incrementally improves a linear control policy for the MountainCar environment using only the replayed history of policy parameters and their resulting rewards. By embedding the optimization goal, the replay buffer contents, and instructions for balancing exploration and exploitation directly into the prompt, the LLM is encouraged to infer the relationship between policy weights and episode returns—treating the environment as an opaque black-box function. Over successive episodes, the model uses in-context learning to identify promising parameter directions, refining its estimates purely from observed outcomes and natural-language guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the MountainCar example, the ProPS methodology generalizes to a broad class of reinforcement learning problems. Because policy updates are communicated and reasoned about through prompt structure rather than backpropagation or explicit gradient computation, LLMs can flexibly integrate reward feedback, natural-language constraints, and high-level instructions in a unified optimization loop. This demonstration highlights how ProPS enables LLMs to participate directly in policy search, showing how linguistic reasoning can complement numerical reasoning to drive self-improvement in simulated control environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Conclusion**\n",
        "This demonstration shows that LLMs can serve as effective policy optimizers in reinforcement learning when guided through structured prompts, capturing the core insight of the ProPS framework. Without access to transition dynamics, reward functions, or gradient information, the LLLM learns to propose increasingly effective policy parameters by interpreting replay-buffer histories and adapting its search strategy over time. Although the LLM is not performing classical RL computation internally, its ability to approximate improved policy updates based solely on contextual feedback validates the ProPS claim that language-based reasoning can drive policy search.\n",
        "\n",
        "ProPS provides an interpretable and flexible mechanism for integrating LLMs into reinforcement-learning loops. Through carefully designed prompts and iterative interaction with the environment, the LLM progressively discovers high-reward policies—demonstrating that linguistic and numerical reasoning, when fused inside a single model, offer a practical pathway for optimizing control behavior in continuous-action domains.\n",
